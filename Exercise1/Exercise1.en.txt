1. Create a database "Filmography".
2. Create tables within this database: Films, Actors, Directors.

Movie (movies): Name(name), Description(description), Year(year), Genres (genres), Country (country), Budget(budget)
Actors (actors): Surname (surname), First name (name), Date of birth (birthday), Country of birth (motherland), Number of films (number_of_movies)
Directors (producer): Surname (surname), First name (name), Date of birth (birthday), Country of birth (motherland)

For films, define Name and Year as primary key
For actors, specify a new column that will be populated with the sequence
Do the same for directors.

Implement check constraints:
on the year field in the film table, that it must be greater than 1900 and less than the current + 10 years.
budget field should not be < 10000
the number of movies field must be greater than 5.

Surname First Name and Date of Birth must be unique for the actor

For the Director table, the Country of birth field should default to USA.

Fill tables with test values, 6 records each
 
3. Change the movie table:
a) remove primary keys
b) add an identifier column (id) with a hung sequence (sequence)
c) think about how to use Alter queries to put this sequence in order. Write requests.
